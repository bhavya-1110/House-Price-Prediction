<h2 align="center"> HOUSE-PRICE PREDICTION </h2>
Welcome to the House Price Prediction project! This project is aimed at predicting the price of a house based on various features using regression techniques. This README file will guide you through the project and provide you with all the necessary information to run the code and reproduce the results.


<h5> PROJECT DESCRIPTION </h5>
The goal of this project is to predict the price of a house based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, etc. The project utilizes a regression model to analyze the data and make predictions. The dataset used in this project contains information of about 20,640 houses including the latitude, longitude, age of house, total rooms,  ocean proximity and various other features.
The project is built using Python and utilizes popular data science libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib. The code is written in Jupyter Notebook and is easy to understand and modify.


<h5> DATASET DESCRIPTION </h5>
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle's California House Price Prediction Different Ways. The dataset contains 10 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in California. The dataset contains 20,640 records and is divided into training and testing sets. The training set contains 16,512 records and the testing set contains 4128 records.


<h5> PROJECT STRUCTURE </h5>
The project is organized into the following directories:
data: contains the raw data files
notebooks: contains the Jupyter Notebook files
output: contains the output files generated by the project
src: contains the source code files

<h5> RUNNING THE PROJECT </h5>
- Clone the repository to your local machine
- Navigate to the notebooks directory ad open the House_Price_Prediction.ipynb file
- Follow the instructions in the notebook to install necessary dependencies and run the code.
- The notebook will generate output files in the output directory

<h5> CONCLUSION </h5>
House price prediction is an important task in the real estate industry. This project provides a framework for predicting house prices using regression techniques. The project utilizes a popular dataset and provides an easy-to-follow codebase that can be used as a starting point for further exploration and development.
