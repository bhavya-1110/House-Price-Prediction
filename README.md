*** HOUSE-PRICE PREDICTION ***
Welcome to the House Price Prediction project! This project is aimed at predicting the price of a house based on various features using regression techniques. This README file will guide you through the project and provide you with all the necessary information to run the code and reproduce the results.


*** PROJECT DESCRIPTION ***
The goal of this project is to predict the price of a house based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, etc. The project utilizes a regression model to analyze the data and make predictions. The dataset used in this project contains information on over 1,000 houses including the sale price, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, the size of the lot, the location of the house, and various other features.

The project is built using Python and utilizes popular data science libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib. The code is written in Jupyter Notebook and is easy to understand and modify.
